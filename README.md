# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
# Economic Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on data exploration of global employment, unemployment, and GDP trends. This project is about finding real stories in global economic data—not just running code.

## The Project

- I cleaned, explored, and visualized employment, unemployment, and GDP data across countries and years.
- I looked for sectoral shifts, unusual unemployment patterns, and how GDP relates to jobs and growth.
- I identified outliers—countries and years that don’t follow the usual trends—and explained why they matter.

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Install Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn**
3. **Run the notebook** [`gloabal.ipynb`]
4. **Update the data file path** if needed

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3** for scripting and automation
- **Pandas & numpy** for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib & seaborn** for clear, honest visuals

## What I Learned

This isn’t just about numbers.  
It’s about spotting real economic shifts, connecting patterns to business and policy, and learning how to communicate insights—the same way a working data analyst would.

## What’s Next

I could keep digging—adding demographic data, policy impacts, or even building predictive models.  
Or, I could pick a country or region that stood out and tell its story in depth.  
Either way, I now have the toolset to turn raw data into actionable insights.
